1. Taken from Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way 

This challenge will be *very* hard because it requires you to fix someone else's code. When you are a programmer you often have to deal with another programmer's code with another programmer's code, and also their arrogance. They will frequently claim their code is perfect. 

These programmers are stupid people who care little for others. A good programmer assumes, like a good scientist, that there's always *some* probablity their code is wrong. Good programmers start from the premise that their software is broken and then work to rule out all possible ways it could be wrong before finally admitting that maybe it really is the other guy's code. 

In this exercise, you practice dealing with a bad programmer by fixing a bad programmer's code. I have put together a couple of exercises and removed random characters and added flaws. Most of the errors are things Python will tell you, while some of them are math errors you should find. Others are formatting errors or spelling mistakes in Strings. 

All of these errors are very common mistakes all programmers make. Even experienced ones. 

Your job is to correct the file. Use all of your skills to make this file better. Fix each flaw and keep running it and fixing it until the script runs perfectly. 

First copy and paste [errors.txt](errors.txt) into your workspace and fix all the errors

2. Write a program that generates a sequence of hailstone numbers The hailstone numbers can be
described succinctly as follows: Start with a positive integer; if that number is even, divide it in
half, and continue; if the number is odd, triple it and add 1, and continue. Proceed in this way
until you arrive at the value 1.  <br><br>
For example, if you start with 20, this is the sequence you get: `20,10,5,16,8,4,2,1`. If you start
with 21, you get this sequence: `21, 64, 32,16, 8, 4, 2, 1`.
