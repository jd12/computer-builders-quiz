1. First copy and paste [errors.txt](errors.txt) into your workspace and fix all the errors

2. Write a program that generates a sequence of hailstone numbers The hailstone numbers can be
described succinctly as follows: Start with a positive integer; if that number is even, divide it in
half, and continue; if the number is odd, triple it and add 1, and continue. Proceed in this way
until you arrive at the value 1.  <br><br>
For example, if you start with 20, this is the sequence you get: `20,10,5,16,8,4,2,1`. If you start
with 21, you get this sequence: `21, 64, 32,16, 8, 4, 2, 1`.
